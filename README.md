# web-audio-player

Somewhat of an experiment with the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and Svelte. A custom web audio player where a user could upload an audio file and control playback in the browser.

The idea is to use class-based modular components to build a more extensive web DJ software eventually, basically hooking up the existing Web Audio classes with Svelte components.

## Installation

Clone the project and run `npm install && npm run dev`.
